The objective of the capstone is to use any public API on my own project from scratch. I have used the FreeToGame API . 
The website allows to browse for a variety of video games free to play and the user should be able to filter and manipulate his search via genre, name, platform and/or sort it by release date, etc.

This is my first project using API. 

I tried for a while to implement a search bar to display a game typed. Eventually i gave up on it, because the API only allows GET requests, and i think i would need a POST request for that. I have tried yet to make it work via GET request, i reseached a lot, tried a bunch of different things, actually i think i took too much time trying to make it work. 

I think there must have some kind of way of doing it, i have seen some ways that i really didn't understand and were way over my level of knowledge, so i decided not to go with it.

CONCLUSION:
All the Capstone objectives were reached, i got envolved on the project and have made way more that requested.
I enjoyed a lot the development on this.
Fortunately i could spend some time only for this Capstone, so it took me an entire week to reach this point. I know it is a lot, but i start learning this more seriously for about to 2 months now (not full-time). So i am actually quite happy and satisfied with the final product.

Have learned way more about ejs and API requests just within this week, than during the almost a month diving into the ejs and API modules.
Sorry for my English :)
